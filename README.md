# Facemoji
Facemoji is a workshop of deeper information about Machine learning to make participants enthusiastic enough to solve the challenges they may face on they to develop ML in the future followed by the hands-on session where participants got to use the provided software and explore the emoji output of their facial recognition. The workshop made a platform for the students to get motivated enough to work on Image Processing using Machine Learning skills.
